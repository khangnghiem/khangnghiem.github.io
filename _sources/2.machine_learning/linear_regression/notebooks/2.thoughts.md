## Thoughts

### Initial questions

- What do we mean by “points that roughly look like they are forming a line”?
- What do we mean by “a line that passes really close to the points”?
- How do we find such a line?
- Why is this useful in the real world?
- Why is this machine learning?

### Linear Regression Formula

- How do we get the computer to come up with this weight and bias?
- By how much should I adjust the weights?
- How many times should I repeat the algorithm? In other words, how do I know when I’m done?
- How do I know that this algorithm works?

### Questions about Models

- What happens if the model makes a mistake?
- How did you come up with the formula that predicts the price? And what would we do if instead of six houses, we had thousands of them?
- Say we’ve built this prediction model, and then new houses start appearing in the market. Is there a way to update the model with new information?
