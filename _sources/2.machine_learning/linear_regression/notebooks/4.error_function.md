## Error Function

- The square error is used more commonly in practice than the absolute error.
- Because A square has a much nicer derivative than an absolute value, which comes in handy during the training process.

MAE:

## Root Mean Square Error

```py
def rmse(labels, predictions):
    n = len(labels)
    differences = np.subtract(labels, predictions)
    return np.sqrt(1.0/n * (np.dot(differences, differences)))
```
