# Decision making

## Three types of decisions

- Rational decision
- Right decision
- Wrong decision

*Lessons learned*

- Beware of mistakes and bias which can influence rational decisions when they turned out wrong.
- Right decision might not necessarily be rational
  
## Heuristics (Automaticity)

- Most of our decisions are made quickly and automatically on a daily basis.
- Sometimes, we rely too much on these automaticity, which blinds our ability to see the potential mistakes.

*Lessons learned*

- **Ask the right questions** before making a decision. These questions should tackle the underlying contexts that aim to minimize automatic decision making based on feeling or intuition.

## Four types of Analytics

- Descriptive Analytics: What happened?
- Diagnostic Analytics: Why did it happen?
- Prescriptive Analytics: What should happen?
- Predictive Analytics: What can happen?

*Lessons learned*

- Mistakes exist between how a decision is made and how it should be made.
