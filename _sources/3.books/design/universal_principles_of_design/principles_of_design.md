# 63. Faith Follows Function

Ideological and spiritual considerations should be secondary to functional considerations. Function should be prioritized.
But often the personal biases, beliefs, and values of designers influence their thinking in ways that run counter to function—i.e., function follows their faith. E.g. Feng shui

# 64. Feature Creep

A continuous expansion or addition of new product features beyond the original scope.
Feature creep is one of the most common causes of cost and schedule overruns.
The key driver is the perception that more is better, and therefore features are continuously added and rarely taken away. But adding features adds complexity, and complexity is expensive.

- Features are easy or convenient to add—this is particularly common in software development.
- Features accumulate over multiple generations of a product.
- Features are added to appease internal project stakeholders. This is often due to what’s called the internal-audience problem: Designers or marketers think they know what’s best for the customer, but they discover that customers disagree.

# 65. Feedback

Information about status or performance used for confirmation, decision-making, and improvement.
Note that for targeted feedback to be effective, the recipient must have the time, opportunity, and ability to act on it.2
Feedback is the foundation for all usability and learning. The rule should be minimum-viable feedback delivered quickly.

# 66. Feedback Loop

A cycle in which output feeds back into a system as input, changing subsequent output.

- Positive feedback loops: Amplify
- Negative feedback loops: Dampen

# 67. Fibonacci Sequence

- The figure has a definite shape, whereas the ground is shapeless.
- The ground continues behind the figure.
- The figure seems closer with a clear location in space, whereas the ground seems farther away and has no clear location in space.
- Elements below a horizon line are likely perceived as figures, whereas elements above a horizon line are likely to be perceived as ground.
- Elements in the lower regions of a design are likely to be perceived as figures, whereas elements in the upper regions are likely to be perceived as ground

Proposed symptoms of groupthink include:

1. Culture of compliance
2. Self-censorship
3. Mindguards
4. Apparent unanimity
5. Illusion of invulnerability
6. Illusion of morality
7. Outgroup bias
8. Confirmation bias

The tendency to follow this left-right, top-bottom path is attributed to reading gravity - habit formed from reading.

# 88. Habituation

Repeated exposure to a stimulus reduces the response to that stimulus.

# 89. Hanlon’s Razor

Never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by incompetence.

# 90. Hick’s Law

Time to make a decision increases as the number of decision options increases.
All tasks consist of four basic steps:

1. Identify a problem or goal.
2. Assess the available options to solve the problem or achieve the goal.
3. Decide on an option.
4. Implement the option.
Hick’s law applies to the third step: Decide on an option.
However, the law does not apply to decisions that involve significant levels of searching, reading, or complex problem solving.
The law is decreasingly applicable as the complexity of tasks increases.

# 91. Hierarchy of Needs

A hierarchy of user-centered goals that a design must satisfy to achieve optimal success.
The hierarchy of needs specifies that a design must serve low-level needs (e.g., it must function) before the higher-level needs, such as creativity, can begin to be addressed.
The five key levels of needs in the hierarchy from lowest to highest are:

1. Functionality
2. Reliability
3. Usability
4. Proficiency
5. Creativity

# 92. Highlighting

# 98. Inattentional Blindness

A failure to perceive an unexpected stimulus presented in clear view.

Strategies to mitigate inattentional blindness include minimizing distractions in the environment (e.g., reducing auditory and visual noise), reducing cognitive load (e.g., chunking elements), strategically interrupting automatized procedures to heighten situational awareness and engage deliberative thought (e.g., using checklists to confirm steps and statuses), and expressing stimuli through different modalities (e.g., repeating instructions using auditory and textual stimuli).

# 99. Interference Effects

5. Retroactive interference (new knowledge interfere with existing one)

# 100. Inverted Pyramid

The presentation of information from most important to least important.

# 101. Iron Triangle

A model that proposes three constraints for all projects: time, cost, and scope.
The iron triangle is commonly introduced by the expression, You can have it good, fast, or cheap; pick two.
In most real-world cases, however, project owners can reliably preserve just one constraint, not two.

# 102. Iteration

Designing things in phases, each phase building on the last, until a desired result is achieved.

- Design iteration
- Development iteration

# 103. Kano Model

A model for understanding customer needs and then prioritizing design features accordingly.

1. Delighter features—Product features that create surprise and delight. Customers are typically unaware of delighters or the problems they solve until they are experienced, after which they can’t imagine life without them. This also means that designers can’t identify delighters by asking or surveying users because customers have no frame of reference for the features.
2. Performance features—Product features that are known and sought out by customers. Customers typically research and compare products based on performance features to make their buying decisions. Accordingly, performance features can be identified through focus groups and surveys. Some competitive baseline level of performance features must be present for a product to be successful.
3. Threshold features—Product features that are assumed to be present and to perform well. Customers typically do not consider threshold features, as they are considered too basic and fundamental to merit attention. Products get no credit for having threshold features that work well, but they get severely punished for not having them.

Remember, customers can’t tell you what delighters are and won’t tell you what threshold features are
Ensure that products have at least one delighter feature (however unrefined), a competitive set of performance features (fairly refined), and a complete set of threshold features (very refined).

# 104. KISS

Simple designs work better and are more reliable than complex designs.
Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.

# 105. Knowing-Doing Gap

The divide that exists between knowing how to do something and actually doing it.

Causes:
(1) talking is mistaken for doing
(2) resistance to change
(3) fear of failure
(4) measuring the wrong things
(5) internal competition

1. Lead with why—Explain why people are being asked to do something before explaining how to do it.
2. Be intentional about execution—Classroom instruction and abstract presentations tend not to transfer to the field.
3. Forgive errors for action—Create a bias for action that is tolerant of mistakes and failure.
4. Eliminate internal competition—Avoid teams competing with one another, especially when compensation or incentives are involved. Internal competition creates barriers to collaboration and invariably renders customer interests secondary to team interests.
5. Measure what matters—Focus on measuring the few things that matter most. In the age of big data, it is tempting to engage in kitchen-sink analytics; but this risks distracting from what’s important.

Walk the talk!

# 106. Learnability

The ease with which a new thing can be understood and productively used.

The four pillars of learnability are:

1. Consistency
2. Discoverability
3. Responsiveness
4. Simplicity

Learnability does not mean leading with tutorials or instruction.
Just the opposite: If a system is learnable, instructions and tutorials aren’t needed.

# 107. Left-Digit Effect

Requires 1 to 10 iterations.2

Level 2: Major Improvement
Solves a complex problem by improving upon one key aspect of that problem, leveraging expertise and best practices within a domain. Designs at this level and above are considered sufficiently novel and nonobvious to be inventions.
Requires 10 to 100 iterations.

Level 3: Major Innovation
Solves a complex problem by conceptualizing it in a new way, leveraging knowledge and best practices from other domains.
Requires multiple level 2 inventions to be in place and 100 to 1,000 iterations.

Level 4: Significant Innovation
Solves a newly discovered problem, requiring a design approach that leverages new science and technology.
Requires multiple level 3 inventions to be in place and 1,000 to 100,000 iterations.3

Level 5: Revolutionary Breakthrough
Solves a newly discovered problem of great significance, requiring an approach that leverages a new scientific breakthrough.
Requires multiple level 4 inventions to be in place and 100,000+ iterations.4
