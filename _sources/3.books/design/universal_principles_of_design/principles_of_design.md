# 1. Principles of Design

# 2. Abbe's law

- Beware of Angular Error, which may spiral out of control

# 3. Accessibility

1. Perceptibility — Achieved when everyone can perceive the design, regardless of sensory abilities.
2. Operability — Achieved when everyone can use the design, regardless of physical abilities.
3. Simplicity — Achieved when everyone can easily learn and understand the design, regardless of experience, literacy, or concentration level.
4. Forgiveness — Achieved when designs minimize the occurrence and consequences of errors.

# 4. Ackoff’s Law

It is better to do the right things wrong than the wrong things right.

The right things refer to your vision / goals

# 5. Aesthetic-Usability Effect

Aesthetic things are perceived to be easier to use than ugly things.
Aesthetic things are often subjectively rated as easier to use, even when no usability advantage can be objectively measured

# 6. Affordance

The physical characteristics of a thing that influence its function and use.
When affordances are good, things perform well and are intuitive to use. When affordances are bad, things perform poorly and are hard to use.

A tendency to view attractive people as intelligent, competent, moral, and sociable.

# 16. Baby-Face Bias

A tendency to see things with baby-faced features as having the characteristics of babies.

# 17. Back of the Dresser

All parts of a design, visible and nonvisible, should be held to the same standard of quality. (e.g. Mac internal components)

# 18. Biophilia Effect

A state of reduced stress and improved concentration resulting from nature views. (e.g. looking at trees)

# 19. Box’s Law

# 20. Brooks’ Law

For certain types of projects, adding people to speed things up inadvertently slows them down.

The use of covert, embedded tests to verify that quality standards have been met. (introduce defects / negative cases for testing)

# 22. Bus Factor

The number of team members who, if lost, would put a project in jeopardy. (avoid bus factor = 1 using automation, cross-training, code reviews, etc.)

# 23. Cathedral Effect

High ceilings promote abstract thinking. Low ceilings promote detail-oriented thinking.

# 24. Causal Reductionism

A tendency to fixate on one cause when solving problems, ignoring the reality of multiple causes. (Root cause is plural)

# 25. Chesterton’s Fence

Seek to understand why things exist the way they do before changing or removing them. (Don't touch if you don't understand why it's there)

# 26. Clarke’s Laws

Three maxims that offer insights into the nature of innovation.

1. When distinguished scientists state that something is possible, they are almost certainly right. When they state that something is impossible, they are very probably wrong.
2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
3. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced. Any sufficiently advanced design looks and feels like magic.

# 27. Classical Conditioning

A method of influencing how a person viscerally responds to a thing.

# 28. Closure

The brain automatically completes recognizable forms when they are interrupted or incomplete.

# 29. Cognitive Dissonance

A state of mental discomfort due to incompatible attitudes, thoughts, and beliefs.
People relieve cognitive dissonance in one of three ways:

- Reduce the importance of the conflicting thought
- Add a new thought to counteract it
- Accept the conflicting thought

# 30. Color Effects

The cognitive and behavioral effects triggered by exposure to colors.

# 31. Color Theory

A body of practical knowledge regarding the application and mixing of colors.

- Number of colors
- Color combinations
- Saturation
- Universal effects

# 32. Common Fate

The brain automatically assumes elements moving in similar ways are related.

# 33. Comparison

A method of highlighting relationships by depicting information in controlled ways.

- Apples to apples
- Single context
- Benchmarks

# 34. Confirmation

A technique for preventing errors by requiring verification before actions are performed.

- Dialog
- Two-step operation

# 35. Confirmation Bias

A tendency to favor information that confirms pre-existing views.
Confirmation bias is a tendency to focus on information that supports preexisting views, ignoring any information that contradicts those views.

# 36. Consistency

Usability and learnability improve when similar things have similar meanings and functions.

# 37. Constraint

Limiting the actions that can be performed to simplify use and prevent error.

# 38. Contour Bias

A tendency to favor things with contoured features over angular or rectilinear features.

# 39. Control

The level of user control should be related to the proficiency and experience of the user.

# 40. Convergence

A tendency for similar characteristics to evolve independently in similar environments.
Consider the level of stability and convergence in an environment prior to design. Stable environments with convergent system designs are receptive to minor innovations and refinements but resist radical departures from established designs.

# 41. Conway’s Law

The structure of an organization is expressed in the design of the things it produces.
Products and services mimic the structure of the teams that create them

# 42. Cost-Benefit

Value is a function of the costs of acquisition and use versus the benefits provided.

# 43. Creator Blindness

The inability of a creator to see fundamental flaws in their creation.

# 45. Death Spiral

A phenomenon in which a social organization persists in behaviors that lead to self-destruction.

# 46. Defensible Space

# 47. Depth of Processing

Thinking hard about a thing improves the likelihood that it can be recalled.

# 48. Design by Committee

A design process based on consensus building, group decision-making, and extensive iteration.

Favor design by dictator when projects are time- or budget-driven, requirements are relatively straightforward, consequences of error are tolerable, and stakeholder buy-in is unimportant. E.g. Startups
Favor design by committee when requirements are highly complex, tolerance for risk is low, consequences of error are serious, and stakeholder buy-in is important. E.g. NASA
