- Submitted Trusting Social's Screening Test
  - One question about SQL, Group by, Joins, Common Table Expressions: The CTE is fairly complex, that last question is very tricky in that you need to use a CTE and join with itself to filter out items
  - One question about Python Data cleaning: Fairly straightforward, mostly renaming, manipulating strings, dtype, replacing with regex, etc.
  - One question about Data Analysis. This question requires a bit of thinking. You need to tinker and play around with the data a bit before choosing which variables are significant and create statistics out of them.
