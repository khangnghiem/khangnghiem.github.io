# Decision Analysis

Cognitive Ease vs Cognitive Strain

- Every step of the way, we attempt to achieve and maintain a state of cognitive ease, i.e. we do our best to avoid thinking deeply.

*Lessons learned*

- Garbage in, garbage out

## Heuristics

- a fancy term for mental shortcuts, i.e. intuition and gut feel
- Cognitive Ease is a habit, our inherent desire to maximize efficiency.
- E.g. We may recall a decision from our past that worked out well, so without having to invest much mental energy, we can draw the conclusion that the same act chosen back then would be the most appropirate this around as well. Do that enough times and we will develop a rule of thumb, allowing for even les mental effort, and speedier decisions the next time around.
--> The mistake is being codified, like an athlete who practices incorrectly, over and over again. This is how we become more mentally "efficient" as we get older.

## Components of a decision

- outcome: problem to be solved
- states: uncontrollable factors that affect our ability to convert an act into the outcome
- acts: potential solution to the problem
--> outcome = acts(*states)

## The Biggest Mistake in Decision-Making

Mistakes:

- We think about "acts" first because we are influenced by emotion or followed by a path derived by the instinctive response.
- The decision process begins with "should I or shouldn't I" --> Cognitive bias
