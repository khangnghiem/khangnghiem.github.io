# Blinded by bias

Game of Poker: Skill and Luck

- Although it has evolved from just luck and reading your opponents to using probability, it is still very much affected by human emotions, which leaves room for human errors
- Mistakes can be capitalised.
- If human factor is removed (i.e. using only computers), no mistakes will every be made.

Optical Illusion: things are not what they seem, no matter how sure you can be

- Questions every detail that you have been 100% sure.
- The more human factor is involved, the greater the chance for bias and mistakes
