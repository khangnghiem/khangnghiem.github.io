# February 2024

## Feb 20, 2024 - Kickboxing Punch

- Found the defect in the code:
  - The mismatch dtype between id columns when merged (in pandas): one being int32, the other being float32
  - The compiler didn't give any alerts or warnings.
- Kickboxing Punch:
  - Turns out Khang did it all wrong. The power of the punch doen't come from his arms! He should have tried to use his core as well as hip, legs and pivot his foot!
  - With that said, Khang realized his legs are really weak.

## Feb 19, 2024 - Guest Day

- Too many guests today: interns (Starcamp & Wecamp), new recruits, lots of special guests visiting from Australia. Some familiar, some aren't.
- Found some errors in the code, again.

## Feb 18, 2024 - Preparing for NAB's executive visit

- Tomorrow is a big day. Khang is very excited. He is excited about all that is coming for (at) him. People are back at work.
- Possibly a new opportunity? A new position? A new event?
- Khang shouldn't have his hopes up, though. Should just be patient.
- Kickboxing basic: Core
  - Core is where most of the power is coming from
  - Brace yourself!

## Feb 17, 2024 - Weekend Work

- The Python code was getting out of hand.
- Too much code in too little time.
- Everytime a change is made, a new layer of complexity is added but there was no time to refactor
- Filter should be done last in the code to prevent missing data if it is used elsewhere. Take advantage of scan_parquet()!

## Feb 16, 2024 - Kickboxing Stance

- Ackoff's Law: It is better to do the right things wrong than the wrong things right.
- Khang just started learning kickboxing during Tet. All the gyms and pools are closed so he needed to find a way to exercise
- Kickboxing Basic: Stance
  - Curl your body, shoulders and brace yourself
  - Keep your elbows perpendicular to the ground!

## Feb 15, 2024 - Back to work

- First working day after the break

## Feb 14, 2024 - Tech Debt

- Dealt with some tech debts leftover
- Kickboxing combo 1:
  - left punch (x2)
  - right punch
  - change stance
  - knee strike

## Feb 13, 2024 - Streamlit

- Streamlit for Data Science (Book)
  - Highly recommended. Simple and concise.
  - Streamlit is a very powerful low-code tool to quickly create a prototype for a Data project
  - Streamlit integrates seamlessly to other python libs
  - My new go-to deployment platform

## Feb 12, 2024 - Data Science

- Took another Data Analysis Test. Same old format:
  - Python
  - CI/CD
  - Data Analysis
  - Machine Learning
  - Streamlit
- TIL:
  - XGBoost - Very powerful ensemble Gradient Descent library
  - Tinkering with XGBRegressor() parameters like n_estimators (1-1000) and learning_rate

## Feb 11, 2024 - Book Hogging

- Finished "Principles of Design" Book
- Next: "Streamlit for Data Science"

## Feb 10, 2024 - Tet is Over

- Shortest Tet Holiday ever. One house visit only.

## Feb 9, 2024 - Machine Learning

### Encoding Categorical Values

- Strategies when dealing with Categorical values
  - Drop Categorical Variables
  - OrdinalEncoder
  - OneHotEncoder (pivot with 0s and 1s)
- Get number of unique entries in each column with categorical data
  - object_nunique = list(map(lambda col: X_train[col].nunique(), object_cols))
  - d = dict(zip(object_cols, object_nunique))
  - sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
  
## Feb 8, 2024 - Venturing Out

- AEON Mall was still crowded today. It will be open during Tet Holidays. - Machine Learning - Missing Values

- Created a Databricks account and wrote my first notebook. (Community Version)
- Kaggle: filling missing values by using techniques:
  - drop null columns
  - impute null values with SimpleImputer()
  - impute null values with column extension (col_name_was_missing)
  - impute null values with different strategies: mean, median, etc.

## Feb 7, 2024 - Untypical before Tet

- Submitted Trusting Social's Screening Test. Pretty generic. Khang is not allowed to give you details of the test, though. He did use Polars to write all the dataframe manipulation for a lot of his work.
  - One series of questions about SQL
    - The CTE was fairly complex and took a large chunk of his time
  - One series of questions about Python Data cleaning
    - Fairly straightforward, mostly renaming, manipulating strings, dtype, replacing with regex, etc.
  - One series of questions about Data Analysis.
    - This question requires a bit of thinking and tinkering.
    - You need to play around with the data a bit before choosing which variables are significant and create statistics out of them.
- Last day of gym before Tet holidays
- Today Khang learned:
  - Data: some Software Engineering skills are really needed to become a good Data Analyst/Engineer
  - Gym: Need to focus on Leg days. Planning to do 2 leg days / week from now
  - Exercise: Need to breathe in between reps: rep - breath - brace - rep - breath - brace - etc. This will create a consistent rhythem and help you focus all your strength in the rep while holding that last bit of the rep by breathing out and in quickly.

## Feb 6, 2024 - Machine Learning

- Started Machine Learning Course on Kaggle
- Finished Decision Tree Regressor exercises
  - Actually not that hard.
  - Split train test was very intuitive to validate predictions.

## Feb 5, 2024 - Khang's First Blog

- First commit to GitHub Pages.
  - However, Khang only committed the HTML so his code won't be public.
  - You can still ask him personally if you want to learn about his code.
- khangnghiem.github.io published

## Feb 4, 2024 - Retro x2

- Khang wrote another email expressing his apology to his managers because apparently he still didn't know what he was doing.

## Feb 3, 2024 - Retro

- Khang wrote an email expressing his concern to his managers because apparently he didn't know what he was doing.

## Feb 2, 2024 - A Start of Something New

- Today Khang learned that there is a good chance he won't be joining a new team at NAB as a Data Analyst.
- But it's OK. Khang believes that if he gave it all 100% effort, he will be well rewarded, in one way or another.
- Quality Engineering wasn't a bad experience. Not at all.
  - He did learn a lot of philosophy about Quality Engineering that could be applied all across multiple industries.
  - QE mindset is much needed to develop high quality products
  - Workflow Automation mindset is really beneficial for long-term or repetitive projects
