- Submitted Trusting Social's Screening Test
  - One question about SQL, Group by, Joins, Common Table Expressions: The CTE is fairly complex, that last question is very tricky in that you need to use a CTE and join with itself to filter out items
  - One question about Python Data cleaning: Fairly straightforward, mostly renaming, manipulating strings, dtype, replacing with regex, etc.
  - One question about Data Analysis. This question requires a bit of thinking. You need to tinker and play around with the data a bit before choosing which variables are significant and create statistics out of them.
- Last day of gym before Tet holidays
- Today I learned:
  - Need to focus on Leg days. Planning to do 2 leg days / week from now
  - Need to breathe in between reps: rep - breath - rep - breath - etc. This will create a consistent rhythem and help you focus all your strength in the rep while holding that last bit of the rep by breathing out and in quickly.
