### Machine Learning - Encoding Categorical Values

- Strategies when dealing with Categorical values
  - Drop Categorical Variables
  - OrdinalEncoder
  - OneHotEncoder (pivot with 0s and 1s)
- Get number of unique entries in each column with categorical data
  - object_nunique = list(map(lambda col: X_train[col].nunique(), object_cols))
  - d = dict(zip(object_cols, object_nunique))
  - sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])

### Venturing Out

- AEON Mall was still crowded today. It will be open during Tet Holidays.

### Machine Learning - Missing Values

- Created a Databricks account and wrote my first notebook. (Community Version)
- Kaggle: filling missing values by using techniques:
  - drop null columns
  - impute null values with SimpleImputer()
  - impute null values with column extension (col_name_was_missing)
  - impute null values with different strategies: mean, median, etc.

### Non-typical day before Tet

- Submitted Trusting Social's Screening Test. Pretty generic. Khang is not allowed to give you details of the test, though. He did use Polars to write all the dataframe manipulation for a lot of his work.
  - One series of questions about SQL
    - The CTE was fairly complex and took a large chunk of his time
  - One series of questions about Python Data cleaning
    - Fairly straightforward, mostly renaming, manipulating strings, dtype, replacing with regex, etc.
  - One series of questions about Data Analysis.
    - This question requires a bit of thinking and tinkering.
    - You need to play around with the data a bit before choosing which variables are significant and create statistics out of them.
- Last day of gym before Tet holidays
- Today Khang learned:
  - Data: some Software Engineering skills are really needed to become a good Data Analyst/Engineer
  - Gym: Need to focus on Leg days. Planning to do 2 leg days / week from now
  - Exercise: Need to breathe in between reps: rep - breath - brace - rep - breath - brace - etc. This will create a consistent rhythem and help you focus all your strength in the rep while holding that last bit of the rep by breathing out and in quickly.

### Machine Learning for the first time

- Started Machine Learning Course on Kaggle
- Finished Decision Tree Regressor exercises
  - Actually not that hard.
  - Split train test was very intuitive to validate predictions.

### Khang's First Blog

- First commit to GitHub Pages.
  - However, Khang only committed the HTML so his code won't be public.
  - You can still ask him personally if you want to learn about his code.
- khangnghiem.github.io published

### Retro x2

- Khang wrote another email expressing his apology to his managers because apparently he still didn't know what he was doing.

### A Start of Something New

- Today Khang learned that there is a good chance he won't be joining a new team at NAB as a Data Analyst.
- But it's OK. Khang believes that if he gave it all 100% effort, he will be well rewarded, in one way or another.
- Quality Engineering wasn't a bad experience. Not at all.
  - He did learn a lot of philosophy about Quality Engineering that could be applied all across multiple industries.
  - QE mindset is much needed to develop high quality products
  - Workflow Automation mindset is really beneficial for long-term or repetitive projects
