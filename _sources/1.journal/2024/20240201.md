- Submitted Trusting Social's Screening Test
  - One question about SQL, Group by, Joins, Common Table Expressions
    - The CTE is fairly complex, that last question is very tricky in that you need to use a CTE and join with itself to filter out items
  - One question about Python Data cleaning
    - Fairly straightforward, mostly renaming, manipulating strings, dtype, replacing with regex, etc.
  - One question about Data Analysis.
    - This question requires a bit of thinking and tinkering.
    - You need to play around with the data a bit before choosing which variables are significant and create statistics out of them.
    - Khang used Polars to write all the dataframe manipulation
- Last day of gym before Tet holidays
- Today Khang learned:
  - Data: some Software Engineering skills are really needed to become a good Data Analyst/Engineer
  - Gym: Need to focus on Leg days. Planning to do 2 leg days / week from now
  - Exercise: Need to breathe in between reps: rep - breath - rep - breath - etc. This will create a consistent rhythem and help you focus all your strength in the rep while holding that last bit of the rep by breathing out and in quickly.

- Today Khang learned that there is a good chance he won't be joining a new team at NAB as a Data Analyst.
- But it's OK. Khang believes that if he gave it all 100% effort, he will be well rewarded, in one way or another.
- Quality Engineering wasn't a bad experience. Not at all.
  - He did learn a lot of philosophy about Quality Engineering that could be applied all across multiple industries.
  - QE mindset is much needed to develop high quality products
  - Workflow Automation mindset is really beneficial for long-term or repetitive projects
